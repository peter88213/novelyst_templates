## Features

In *novelyst*, you can define a narrative structure with *stages* on two different levels. *novelyst_templates* faciliates the reuse of narrative structures.

- Load the narrative structure from a Markdown template file:
    - When loading a template into an empty project, a whole story framework is created.
    - When loading a template into a project that has already chapters, a list of stages is created in an "unused" chapter.
- Save the narrative structure to a Markdown template file.
