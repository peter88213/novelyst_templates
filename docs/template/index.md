## Features

In *novelyst*, you can define a narrative structure with "Todo" Parts, Chapters, and scenes. See [Arcs](https://peter88213.github.io/novelyst/help/arcs). *novelyst_templates* faciliates the reuse of narrative structures.

- Load the narrative structure from a Markdown template file. Each stage is converted into a "Todo" scene:
    - When loading a template into an empty project, a whole story framework is created.
    - When loading a template into a project that has already chapters, a list of stages is created in a "Todo" chapter.
- Save the narrative structure to a Markdown template file.
